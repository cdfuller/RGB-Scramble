# RGB-Scramble

This is an ongoing project to recreate the work found at [All RGB colors in one image](http://joco.name/2014/03/02/all-rgb-colors-in-one-image/) in Python. This creates images that have a different color for every pixel.

Browse the tags to checkout the different iterations of the project.
